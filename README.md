# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 
  Ruby '2.5.0'
  Rails, '~> 5.2.2'
  Sqlite3', '~>1.3.6'
  
This was an exercise from The Odin Project where you learn how to build,migrate.,associate, and validate data and models from the command line and in the files inside rails!  
  
Project 2: Micro-Reddit
Let’s build Reddit. Well, maybe a very junior version of it called micro-reddit. In this project, you’ll build the data structures necessary to support link submissions and commenting. We won’t build a front end for it because we don’t need to… you can use the Rails console to play around with models without the overhead of making HTTP requests and involving controllers or views.
